// Context nudge: a PostToolBatch hook, registered in .claude/settings.json (the starter kit's copy registers it, with
// the 250k autocompact). Claude cannot see its own context size, so this tells the main session when it crosses 150k
// (ask the owner for /compact at the next clean point) and again at 200k (carry on; the autocompact at 250k is the
// backstop). The thresholds sit below `autoCompactWindow`: change one, check the other. Sigmund's "Across the session"
// says what to do at each line, so the lines cite only his skill, never a CLAUDE.md section.
// It keeps the highest level it has announced for each session in a small file (`level` and `last`), so a level is said
// once and a turn that ended without a tool call cannot hide a crossing. A reading at least 30,000 tokens below the last
// one stored is a compaction: it says the post-compaction line once and re-arms. A session's first run writes that
// file too, which is how a pilot checks the hook runs. Silent otherwise, silent inside subagents, and it exits 0
// whatever happens: a nudge must never block.
//
// [edit] LINES and COMPACTED only: the owner's name in place of "the owner" if the project uses it, and Sigmund's
// path if the project installs him elsewhere. Everything below them is mechanics; leave it as it is so a template
// sync merges cleanly.
